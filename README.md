# 🧱 Voxel-CV  
### Interactive 3D World with Head Tracking

An experimental **Minecraft-inspired voxel environment** built on the web, where the **camera is controlled using real-time head movement** via computer vision.

This project blends **Computer Vision**, **3D Graphics**, and **User Interaction** to explore non-traditional, immersive interfaces.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🎥 Real-time head tracking using **MediaPipe Face Mesh**
- 🎮 First-person navigation with **WASD controls**
- ➕ Crosshair-based voxel placement in a 3D world
- ☁️ Block-style clouds, pixel textures, lighting & fog
- 🌐 Runs fully in the browser (no backend required)

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Three.js** – 3D rendering & scene management  
- **MediaPipe Face Mesh** – Head pose estimation  
- **JavaScript / HTML / CSS** – Core logic & UI  
- **WebGL** – Hardware-accelerated graphics  

---

## 🕹️ Controls

- **W / A / S / D** – Move forward, left, back, right  
- **Mouse** – Aim crosshair  
- **Left Click** – Place voxel block  
- **Head Movement** – Rotate camera (yaw & pitch)  

> ⚠️ Camera access is required for head tracking.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project was to:

- Explore **real-time computer vision in the browser**
- Build a **non-dashboard, visually engaging portfolio project**
- Understand **3D interaction, performance, and UX constraints**
- Create something that **makes people stop scrolling and watch**
